When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You can use other computers to work on your projects. Besides, you can share your projects easily.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe the changes is not what I do locally.
